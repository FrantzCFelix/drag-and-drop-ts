# Drag&Drop-ts

## A mini-project to aid in my learning of typescript, written in an OOP design pattern.

### Description

###### This is just a small project manager app where you can add a project with a title, description and number of workers. They are added to the active section and you can drag and drop them into the finished section.

### How to start

###### npm i from the root directory, npm run build which will build a webpack bundle, then npm run start which will start a webpack dev server to serve everything in the /dist folder as a static asset.
